# CS250-24EW4 - Final Project Sprint Review and Retrospective

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
### Understanding what users need and putting those needs into a program is really important in software development. To do this well, we use something called "user stories." These are short descriptions of what a feature should do from the perspective of the person using it. They help us focus on what the user wants and break down big tasks into smaller ones that we can work on step by step.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
### When I'm working on developing programs, I want to use agile processes. These are ways of working that are flexible and encourage teamwork. Agile methods like Scrum or Kanban help us improve our work continuously, plan things out as we go, and work closely with others. By using agile, we can adapt quickly to changes, make things better over time, and deliver what users need in small, regular updates.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
### Being a good team member in software development means more than just knowing how to code. It's also about communicating well, working together with others, and focusing on what the team needs to achieve. Good team members take part in discussions, share what they know, and help their teammates when needed. They're open to feedback, ready to learn from others, and always do their part to make sure the team succeeds. Plus, they understand the importance of being reliable and doing their job well to make sure users get the best possible software.
